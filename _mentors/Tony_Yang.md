biography: >
  While Tony was pursuing my B.Sc. degree, one of his mentors suggested that he should consider pursuing an Engineering degree to enrich his theoretical studies in Physics and Life Sciences. Consequently, he began his graduate studies with Chemical and Biological Engineering. With a team of scientists and engineers, a microfluidic electrochemical biosensor, which could be used to detect Tuberculosis, was developed as part of his Ph.D. research project. In 2013, he founded Elite Mentors Association, a BC-registered non-profit organization that provides an opportunity for motivated high school students to explore potential career options in Science, Engineering, Business, Marketing, and Performing Arts.
