biography: >
  Vasilii is an aspiring entrepreneur, dreamer, and Ph.D. Candidate in ChemBio engineering. While trying to commercialize his research on smart polymers and participating in start-up programs and competitions he became dissatisfied with his experiences. Most of the programs were too focused on technology push rather than doing a market pull. With his vision of creating a platform to match the industry problems with student teams to solve them, he co-founded Innovation OnBoard.  Besides Innovation OnBoard Vasilii acted as a graduate advisor of Envision student design team (+50 multi-project Design Group and winner of the 2017 AIChE World Chem-E-Car competition), he is a graduate of Graduate Management Consulting program and winner of the 2016 Business Case Competition.
