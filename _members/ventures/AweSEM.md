  In recent years there has been a boom in the pursuit of frugal science projects, which bring state-of-the-art technology to those who would typically not have access. However, many technologies are still wait­ing for innovative breakthroughs that will make them accessible to everyone. One of the most fascinating and useful areas of technolo­gy is high resolution imaging, which is typically done with an electron microscope. However, electron microscopy is reserved only to those who can afford the high cost - mainly top notch educational institu­tions and highly successful corporations. This leaves the less fortu­nate vulnerable to the ill effects of not being able to properly analyze or quantify their problems. 
  An all too real example of this lies in health clinics around the world where complex medical diagnostic equipment, which includes elec­tron microscopes, are not available due to the associated costs, leaving many to suffer the consequences. My innovative project con­sists of bringing electron microscopy to the masses by designing, building, and commercializing an inexpensive and portable scanning electron microscope.
