  Each year, around 222,500 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in America. Most of these peopleâ€™s lung cancer is diagnosed when it is already in its later stages. As a result, the survival rates of people with lung cancer is extremely low. Over the past 10 months, we have been developing an assay for the early detection of lung cancer from blood samples. This assay uses inexpensive components and does not require any additional expensive equipment compared to what can be found in most diagnostic labs.
