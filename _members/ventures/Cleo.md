  One in three women experiences urinary incontinence at some point in their lives. This often happens after trauma, such as childbirth. Current best practice guidelines show that pelvic floor exercises (Ke- gels) are effective in fixing this. We will design a device (molded vagi- nal-shaped probe from medical grade silicone) that will be inserted into the vagina to guide women to do Kegels correctly. A mobile app will provide biofeedback. The invention will use near-infrared spec- troscopic technology for non-invasive transvaginal monitoring of urological tissues. The device and the app will be offered directly to women and will be used for pelvic floor exercises at home.
