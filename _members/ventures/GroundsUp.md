  According to the City of Vancouver, 2.6 million disposable coffee cups are wasted every week within the municipality, a statistic that is representative of North American urban culture of single-use item consumption. To sustain this habit, the production of single-use coffee cups results in the excessive exploitation of natural resources and also contributes to a large portion of urban waste and landfill mass. Grounds-Up Solutions is currently devel- oping a compostable single-use hot beverage cup alternative that is made from used coffee grounds and natural binding agents. This solution would help preserve our planetâ€™s natural resources and reduce the quantity of non-compostable waste, all in an eco- nomical manner.
