  Lack of fluid identity confirmation and ownership of information. We want people to be able to constantly be able to prove their identity without needing the various IDs in circulation.We seek to create a system that operates on top of current peer-to-peer computing systems like Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum network. It would allow people, companies, and governments to own the information that they should own, and allow other parties to request information in a decentralized manner.
